# Wordle-in-Java
By hlq

This is a project I have been working on for a few days.
I am doing this to practice coding.
I am pretty new to coding, Java is the first language I learned.
I hope to progress this pretty far with NO plans to add an actual graphical interface. 
If you wish to look at the wordList.dat file, you will see every wordle there has been and will be
so if you don't want spoilers, don't look!
